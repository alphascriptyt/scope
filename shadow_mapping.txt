*Implementing Shadow Mapping*

Basic Concept:
- Render scene from perspective of light, only need the depth buffer/map.
- Render scene from perspective of camera, compare each pixel to a pixel in the depth map, 
	if further than the pixel in the depth map, the pixel is in shadow.

- For a point light, we must render a depth map for a cube surrounding the point light.



When drawing:

- To look up the shadow map, we need coordinates on the shadow map for each vertex, or a matrix to convert from view space to image/shadow space?




when drawing, the vertices need to know their coordinate in the shadow map so they can lerp it.


essentially for every light... we're looking up a texture? how is this going to work. AND FOR EVERY POINT LIGHT.... 6 TEXTURES.....
